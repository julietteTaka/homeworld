# homeworld
Debian 11 theme

Homeworld is a theme inspired by the Bauhaus movement, an art style born in Germany in the early 20th century and characterized by its unique approach to architecture and design.
As architecture and design are at the very core of software building, I wanted to create a bridge between this art style and Debian.
